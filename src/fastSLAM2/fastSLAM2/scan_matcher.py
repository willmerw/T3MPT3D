"""Correlative coarse-to-fine scan matcher.

This is the "pose correction using scan matching" of hello-slam's
`4_grid_based_slam.ipynb`: transform the beam endpoints by a candidate pose,
look up the particle's own occupancy probabilities there, and keep the
candidate with the highest agreement.

Correlation is legitimate here because the result is only ever used as an
argmax -- the location of the maximum, not its value. It must never be used as
tau in the proposal, where an unnormalized score would corrupt the proposal
mean and covariance as well as the weights.

## Scale of the Gaussian motion prior relative to the correlation score.
##
## This is a heuristic, and deliberately so: the score mixes an UNNORMALIZED
## correlation with a proper log-density, so there is no principled exchange
## rate between them. Larger values pin the match to the odometry prediction,
## smaller ones let the scan pull it further. The prior's sigmas are not set
## here -- they come from `cfg.scan_match_prior_sigmas`, i.e. from the motion
## model. The prior shapes which candidate wins but is excluded from the
## reported score, so a fixed `match_score_min` keeps its meaning.
